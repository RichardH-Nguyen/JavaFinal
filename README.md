# Marvel API Search

Uses the marvel API to search and look at descriptions of Marvel super heroes or comic book titles.

Known bugs: When searching a character or comic the search will complete and but won't fill the listbox. Doing the search
doing the same search again should update the listbox.

Create a new file named urlKey.txt and put your public then your private key inside.
